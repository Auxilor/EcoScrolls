  mask:
    # The way the mask works is by having a list of materials
    # And then a pattern to use those materials.

    # The pattern is the rows in the GUI
    # Each line must be 9 long, and the amount of rows should be the amount of rows in the GUI
    # A zero represents nothing
    # A 1 represents the first material
    # A 2 represents the second material
    # And so on, you can add up to 9.
